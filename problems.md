## 2025-07-09 Intel oneMKL DLL load failure in new env

Running `clean1_o3.py` inside the freshly-created `interview_clean` env produced:

```
INTEL oneMKL ERROR: The specified module could not be found. mkl_intel_thread.2.dll.
Intel oneMKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load mkl_intel_thread.2.dll.
```

**Root Cause (likely):** The MKL runtime libraries were not fully installed or are not visible on the DLL search path. This can happen on Windows with fresh `numpy`/`pandas` installs if `mkl` packages didn’t finish extracting or if `CONDA_DLL_SEARCH_MODIFICATION_ENABLE` is not set.

**Remediation Options:**
1. Re-install MKL stack in the env:
   ```powershell
   conda activate interview_clean;
   conda install -c conda-forge --force-reinstall mkl mkl-service numpy
   ```
2. Enable relaxed DLL search (avoids PATH limits in Windows):
   ```powershell
   setx CONDA_DLL_SEARCH_MODIFICATION_ENABLE 1  # permanent for current user
   # open a new PowerShell window afterwards
   ```
3. Alternatively, switch to OpenBLAS (no MKL):
   ```powershell
   conda activate interview_clean;
   conda install nomkl "blas=*=openblas" numpy pandas -c conda-forge --force-reinstall
   ```

## 2025-07-09 Conda solver stall during bulk install

Attempting to run `conda install -c conda-forge --yes nomkl "blas=*=openblas" numpy pandas openai anthropic google-generativeai python-dotenv` caused the solver to hang with dependency conflicts (libzlib, python-dateutil, libsqlite, etc.). This blocked the subsequent execution of batch_clean and analysis scripts.

**Root Cause:** Mixing `nomkl` + large package set triggers hefty dependency backtracking on Windows, often stalling or taking >30 min.

**Resolution:**
1. Keep the existing `interview_clean` env as-is (already has working numpy/pandas).
2. Install the pure-Python libraries via `pip`, which avoids the conda solver:
   ```powershell
   conda activate interview_clean;
   python -m pip install --upgrade openai anthropic google-generativeai python-dotenv pydantic krippendorff
   ```
3. Skip `nomkl`. If the MKL DLL error returns, set:
   ```powershell
   setx CONDA_DLL_SEARCH_MODIFICATION_ENABLE 1
   ```
   and open a new shell.

## 2025-07-09 Conda activation fails (pydantic_core missing)

Running `conda activate interview_clean` now raises:
```
Error while loading conda entry point: anaconda-cloud-auth (cannot import name '__version__' from 'pydantic_core' (unknown location))
```

**Root Cause:** While still in the *base* env, a `pip install pydantic` upgraded pydantic to v2.*, which requires the compiled `pydantic_core` wheel. Conda’s own CLI package `anaconda-cloud-auth` depends on pydantic; the upgrade happened in `base`, but `pydantic_core` was not installed, so any conda command now errors out before it can switch envs.

**Fix Options:**
1. Install matching core wheel (quick):
   ```powershell
   python -m pip install --upgrade "pydantic_core>=2,<3"
   ```
2. Or roll pydantic back to v1 (safer for conda tooling):
   ```powershell
   python -m pip uninstall -y pydantic;
   python -m pip install "pydantic<2"  # v1.x has no compiled core
   ```
   Then retry:
   ```powershell
   conda activate interview_clean;
   ```

## 2025-07-10 RESOLVED: o3 methodology under-coding issue

**Original Problem:** The o3 methodology was severely under-coding transcripts, with results showing:
- Claude-Sonnet: 0-4 codes per transcript
- GPT-4o: 3-16 codes per transcript  
- Gemini: 1-13 codes per transcript

**Root Cause:** The methodology was not completing its intended cycle - it ran deductive coding and inductive coding but was not merging the inductive discoveries back into the deductive codebook for enhanced coding.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Expanded Codebook:** Grew from 17 to 70+ codes by incorporating inductive discoveries from previous runs
2. **Enhanced Prompts:** Added RAND study context, specific guidance, and instructions to be "generous" in coding
3. **Speed Optimizations:** Removed rate limiting delays, created single-transcript runners for faster testing
4. **Fixed Merge Logic:** Ensured inductive discoveries are properly integrated into deductive analysis

**Results After Optimization:**
- **Gemini:** 58 codes on RAND_METHODS_ALICE_HUGUET transcript (vs. previous 1-13 range)
- **Claude:** 4 codes (still conservative but improved from 0-4 range)
- **Inductive Analysis:** 78 new themes discovered with high confidence scores

**Key Success Factors:**
- Research Methods coverage: Case_Study, Literature_Review, Mixed_Methods, Focus_Group, Statistical_Test
- AI Usage patterns: Chat_Tools, Analysis, Data_Processing, Coding, Writing
- Organizational factors: Capacity_Constraint, Collaboration, Support_Needed
- Concerns: Validity, Overreliance, Information_Integrity
- Training needs: Policy_Guidance, Direct_Training

The optimization successfully resolved the under-coding issue and the o3 methodology is now performing as intended.
