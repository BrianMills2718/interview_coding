# Optimization Recommendations Based on Critical Review

## Priority 1: Domain Detection and Adaptation (CRITICAL)

### Problem
All methodologies assume AI/research context without verification, leading to 100% failure rate on out-of-domain content.

### Solution Architecture
```python
class DomainDetector:
    def analyze_transcript(self, text):
        # 1. Extract key terms and topics
        # 2. Score against multiple domain profiles
        # 3. Select best-fit domain or "unknown"
        # 4. Load appropriate codebook
        
    domains = {
        "ai_research": ["AI", "machine learning", "automation", "RAND"],
        "product_feedback": ["interface", "feature", "user experience", "bug"],
        "medical": ["patient", "treatment", "diagnosis", "symptoms"],
        "education": ["student", "learning", "curriculum", "assessment"]
    }
```

### Implementation Steps
1. Create domain detection module that runs BEFORE coding
2. Build domain profiles from key terms, patterns, and context
3. Implement confidence scoring for domain match
4. Create domain-specific codebooks
5. Add "emergent coding" fallback for unknown domains

---

## Priority 2: Fix Hallucination in Reports (HIGH)

### Problem
Reports contain hardcoded context (RAND, AI adoption) even with empty results.

### Solution
```python
class AdaptiveReportGenerator:
    def generate_report(self, results, detected_domain, transcript_stats):
        # Dynamic report based on:
        # - What was actually found
        # - Detected domain
        # - Coverage statistics
        
        if results.is_empty():
            return self.generate_empty_results_report(detected_domain)
        else:
            return self.generate_domain_specific_report(results, detected_domain)
```

### Templates Needed
1. `empty_results_template.md` - Explains why no codes found
2. `low_confidence_template.md` - Flags uncertain results  
3. `domain_mismatch_template.md` - Explains domain detection
4. `emergent_coding_template.md` - Reports discovered themes

---

## Priority 3: Implement Coverage Metrics (HIGH)

### Problem
No methodology reports what percentage of transcript was meaningfully coded.

### Solution
```python
class CoverageAnalyzer:
    def analyze_coverage(self, transcript, coding_results):
        return {
            "total_utterances": len(transcript.utterances),
            "coded_utterances": len(coding_results),
            "coverage_percent": (len(coding_results) / len(transcript.utterances)) * 100,
            "high_confidence_codes": sum(1 for r in coding_results if r.confidence > 0.8),
            "uncoded_content": self.extract_uncoded_sections(transcript, coding_results)
        }
```

### Metrics to Track
1. Utterance coverage (% of turns coded)
2. Token coverage (% of words in coded segments)
3. Confidence distribution
4. Uncoded content analysis

---

## Priority 4: Hybrid Deductive-Inductive Approach (MEDIUM)

### Problem
Pure deductive coding fails when domains don't match; pure inductive can miss important patterns.

### Solution
```python
class HybridCoder:
    def code_transcript(self, transcript, domain_confidence):
        if domain_confidence > 0.8:
            # High confidence: Use deductive with inductive supplement
            deductive_results = self.deductive_code(transcript)
            inductive_results = self.inductive_code_uncovered(transcript, deductive_results)
        else:
            # Low confidence: Lead with inductive
            inductive_results = self.inductive_code_full(transcript)
            deductive_results = self.attempt_deductive_mapping(inductive_results)
        
        return self.merge_results(deductive_results, inductive_results)
```

---

## Priority 5: Sanity Checks and Validation (MEDIUM)

### Problem
No detection of impossible results (100% coding rate, 0% for all codes).

### Solution
```python
class OutputValidator:
    def validate_results(self, results, transcript):
        warnings = []
        
        # Check for suspicious patterns
        if results.all_codes_100_percent():
            warnings.append("CRITICAL: All codes at 100% - likely false positives")
            
        if results.all_codes_0_percent() and transcript.has_content():
            warnings.append("CRITICAL: No codes found despite content - check domain match")
            
        if results.coverage < 0.1:
            warnings.append("WARNING: Less than 10% coverage - consider domain mismatch")
            
        return warnings
```

### Validation Rules
1. Flag 100% or 0% coding rates
2. Check coverage thresholds
3. Verify output aligns with input domain
4. Compare across models for consistency

---

## Priority 6: Dynamic Prompt Generation (LOW)

### Problem
Hardcoded prompts assume specific context.

### Solution
```python
class DynamicPromptBuilder:
    def build_prompt(self, transcript_sample, detected_domain, codebook):
        base_prompt = f"""
        Analyze this {detected_domain} transcript using the provided codes.
        
        Sample content: {transcript_sample}
        
        Codes to apply: {codebook}
        
        If codes don't fit well, note this and suggest alternatives.
        """
        return base_prompt
```
