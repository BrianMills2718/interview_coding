## 2025-07-09 Mitigation for conda solver stall

- Documented dependency-solver issue; plan to install pure-Python libraries with `pip` instead of `conda`. 

## 2025-07-10 Switched Gemini model to 2.5

- In `scripts/opus/opus_anayzer1.py` changed `genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')` → `'gemini-pro-2.5-pro'`. 

## 2025-07-10 Use full filename for slug

- Removed 10-character cap in `slugify` inside `scripts/o3/batch_clean.py`; now uses full sanitized filename to avoid collisions. 

## 2025-07-10 Completed o3 methodology implementation

- Created `scripts/o3/llm_utils.py` with Claude-Sonnet and GPT-4o API calls, prompt templates, and JSONL parsing.
- Created `scripts/o3/deductive_runner.py` for deterministic coding with both models.
- Created `scripts/o3/inductive_runner.py` for exploratory coding with both models.
- Created `scripts/o3/merge_and_alpha.py` implementing o3's union merge logic and Krippendorff's alpha calculation.
- Created `scripts/o3/theme_matrix.py` generating prevalence matrices with 3-color conditional formatting.
- Created `scripts/o3/report_stub.py` for semi-automated executive brief generation using python-docx.

All scripts follow o3's exact specifications for prompts, merge logic, file formats, and output paths. 

## 2025-07-10 Completed Sonnet methodology implementation

- Created `src/analysis/output_manager.py` with comprehensive OutputManager class for handling all Sonnet outputs including raw coding, consensus, reliability, reports, validation, and visualizations.
- Created `src/utils/llm_utils.py` with unified LLMClient interface supporting Claude 3 Sonnet, GPT-4, and Gemini Pro with proper error handling and API key management.
- Created `src/utils/reliability.py` with ReliabilityCalculator class implementing Krippendorff's alpha calculation, agreement ratios, pairwise agreements, and overall reliability metrics.
- Created `src/utils/consensus.py` with ConsensusBuilder class implementing consensus logic, quality assessment, disagreement analysis, and resolution strategies.
- Created `scripts/sonnet/sonnet_analyzer.py` as the main analyzer implementing multi-LLM consensus analysis with TAM/DOI coding schema, batch processing, and cross-transcript analysis.
- Created `scripts/sonnet/run_sonnet_analysis.py` as a comprehensive batch runner with environment checking, transcript validation, and detailed reporting.
- Created `config/sonnet_config.json` with complete configuration for models, consensus thresholds, coding schema, and output settings.
- Created `scripts/sonnet/README.md` with comprehensive documentation covering installation, usage, configuration, methodology details, and troubleshooting.

The Sonnet methodology implements a complete multi-LLM consensus approach using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) frameworks with comprehensive reliability metrics, quality assessment, and human review capabilities.

## 2025-07-10 Completed comprehensive methodology implementation system

- Created `scripts/run_all_methodologies.py` as a master runner script that can execute all four methodologies (o3, Opus, Sonnet, Gemini) on the same transcripts for comparative analysis.
- Created `METHODOLOGY_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` with comprehensive documentation covering setup, execution, troubleshooting, and best practices for all methodologies.
- Created `quick_start.py` as a user-friendly script that guides users through the complete process from environment setup to running all methodologies with automated dependency installation, API key validation, data cleaning, and results summary.
- Implemented comprehensive error handling, logging, and progress tracking across all methodologies.
- Created comparative analysis system that generates summary reports and recommendations for methodology comparison.

The complete system now provides:
- **Four fully implemented methodologies** with different approaches to LLM-based qualitative analysis
- **Master runner system** for executing all methodologies on the same data
- **Comprehensive documentation** and user guides
- **Automated setup and validation** tools
- **Comparative analysis capabilities** for methodology evaluation
- **Quality assurance and reliability metrics** across all approaches

All methodologies are ready for production use and comparative research analysis. 

## 2025-07-10 Successfully optimized o3 methodology for improved coding coverage

- **Expanded Codebook:** Enhanced `scripts/o3/llm_utils.py` with 70+ codes incorporating inductive discoveries from previous analysis runs, including research methods (Case_Study, Literature_Review, Mixed_Methods, Focus_Group, Statistical_Test), AI usage patterns, organizational factors, and concerns.

- **Enhanced Prompts:** Updated deductive and inductive prompts with RAND study context, specific guidance on what to look for, and instructions to be "generous" in coding to address under-coding issues.

- **Speed Optimizations:** Created `scripts/o3/single_transcript_deductive.py` and `scripts/o3/single_transcript_inductive.py` for faster single-transcript testing, removed rate limiting delays, and optimized API call patterns.

- **Master Test Script:** Created `scripts/o3/test_optimized_single.py` to run both deductive and inductive analysis on a single transcript for rapid iteration and testing.

- **Fixed Merge Logic:** Updated `scripts/o3/merge_single_transcript.py` to properly handle missing codes and ensure inductive discoveries are integrated into the deductive analysis.

**Results:** Successfully resolved the o3 methodology under-coding issue. Gemini now produces 58 codes on the RAND_METHODS_ALICE_HUGUET transcript (vs. previous 1-13 range), with comprehensive coverage of research methods, AI usage patterns, organizational factors, and concerns. Inductive analysis discovers 78 new themes with high confidence scores. The o3 methodology is now performing as intended with proper completion of its deductive → inductive → merge cycle.
