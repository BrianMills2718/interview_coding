# Specific Examples: Transcript vs Coding Outputs

## Example 1: Real-time Editing Discussion

**What was actually said:**
> Charlie: "The real-time editing is fantastic. It really helps our team work together efficiently."

**How it was coded:**

### O3 Methodology:
- Claude: [No code]
- GPT-4: `RM_METHOD::Focus_Group` + `RM_STEP::Data_Collection`
- Analysis: GPT-4 sees "team work" and codes it as research methodology. Complete semantic mismatch.

### Opus Methodology:
- All models: [No code]
- Analysis: Correctly identifies this isn't about AI research methods.

### Sonnet Methodology:
- Coded as: `BENEFIT_EFFICIENCY`, `WORKFLOW_INTEGRATION`, `SUCCESS_STORIES`
- Analysis: Forces collaboration tool feedback into AI adoption framework. "Success story" about what AI system?

### Gemini Methodology:
- OpenAI: `COLLABORATION;EFFICIENCY_GAINS` (90% confidence)
- Anthropic: `COLLABORATION;EFFICIENCY_GAINS` (95% confidence)
- Analysis: Most reasonable mapping, though still using wrong domain codes.

**Verdict**: Only Gemini attempts reasonable interpretation; others fail completely.

## Example 2: Notification Problem

**What was actually said:**
> Bob: "Well, when multiple people comment quickly, some notifications don't appear in the activity feed."

**How it was coded:**

### O3 Methodology:
- GPT-4: `RM_METHOD::Focus_Group` + `RM_STEP::Data_Collection`
- Analysis: Codes a bug report as research methodology. Nonsensical.

### Opus Methodology:
- All models: [No code]
- Analysis: Correct - this isn't about AI or research.

### Sonnet Methodology:
- Coded as: `BARRIER_TECHNICAL`, `BARRIER_QUALITY`
- Analysis: Maps UI bug to "AI adoption barrier" - completely fabricated context.

### Gemini Methodology:
- OpenAI: `METHODOLOGY_CONCERNS` (75% confidence)
- Analysis: Stretches "notification issues" to "research methodology concerns" - forced mapping.

**Verdict**: All fail to recognize this as simple bug report about collaboration software.

## Example 3: Integration Success

**What was actually said:**
> Diana: "On the positive side, the integration with our existing tools has been seamless."

**How it was coded:**

### O3 Methodology:
- GPT-4: `RM_METHOD::Focus_Group` + `RM_STEP::Data_Collection`
- Analysis: Generic focus group tag, ignores actual content.

### Sonnet Methodology:
- Coded as: `SUCCESS_STORIES`, `BENEFIT_CAPABILITY`
- Analysis: Assumes this is about AI tool integration at RAND. Pure hallucination.

### Gemini Methodology:
- OpenAI: `INSTITUTIONAL_FACTORS` (85% confidence)
- Anthropic: `INSTITUTIONAL_FACTORS;EFFICIENCY_GAINS` (90% confidence)
- Analysis: Maps "tool integration" to institutional AI adoption factors. Creative but wrong domain.

**Verdict**: None recognize this as praise for software integration capabilities.

---

## Example 4: Feature Request

**What was actually said:**
> Diana: "I'd like to see more customization options for workflows."

**How it was coded:**

### O3 Methodology:
- GPT-4: `RM_METHOD::Focus_Group` + `RM_STEP::Data_Collection`
- Analysis: Same meaningless tags for every utterance.

### Sonnet Methodology:
- Likely coded as: `FUTURE_VISION` or similar
- Analysis: Interprets feature request as vision for AI adoption.

### Gemini Methodology:
- OpenAI: `FUTURE_VISION` (75% confidence)
- Analysis: Reasonable code name but wrong context - this isn't about AI futures.

**Verdict**: Simple feature request misinterpreted through AI research lens.

---

## Summary Statistics

### Coverage Analysis:
- **Total meaningful utterances**: 19
- **Correctly interpreted**: ~0-2 per methodology
- **False positives**: 15-19 per methodology
- **Missed insights**: 17-19 per methodology

### What Was Missed:
1. **Positive Feedback** (5 instances):
   - "quite intuitive"
   - "navigation is straightforward"  
   - "real-time editing is fantastic"
   - "version history... saved us several times"
   - "integration... has been seamless"

2. **Issues/Bugs** (3 instances):
   - "trouble finding advanced features"
   - "notifications get lost"
   - "mobile notifications are inconsistent"

3. **Feature Requests** (3 instances):
   - "Better mobile experience"
   - "notification system" improvements
   - "more customization options"

### What Was Hallucinated:
- AI adoption patterns at RAND
- Research methodology discussions
- Technology acceptance barriers
- Success stories about AI implementation
- Concerns about AI validity/ethics

## The Core Problem Illustrated

**Input**: A focus group about collaboration software UX
**Output**: Analysis of AI adoption in research organizations

This is like analyzing a recipe for chocolate cake and producing a report about automotive manufacturing trends. The sophistication of the analysis cannot overcome fundamental domain mismatch.
